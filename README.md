# mobie Voice AI Hackathon Starter

Build a German-speaking phone assistant that resolves locations, searches rides
and submits booking requests after explicit caller confirmation. This starter
uses the dedicated **`/integrations/voice` API** and your organizer-issued **team
integration secret**. There is no browser login, callback or token refresh flow.
Node.js built-ins only; no runtime dependencies.

## Update and start

Requirements: Node.js **22+** (24 LTS recommended), enabled team access from
Maximilian/the organizers, and registered staging test passengers. Use the API
origin and credential supplied by the organizers. Credentials are shared privately.

For an existing clone:

```sh
git pull --ff-only
npm run setup
```

For a new checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mobie-code/mobie-hackathon-starter.git
cd mobie-hackathon-starter
npm run setup
```

1. Put the organizer-issued `VOICE_INTEGRATION_SECRET` in `.env`. Keep
   `MOBIE_API_URL=https://api-staging.mobie.at` unless instructed otherwise.
2. Run `npm start` and open **http://localhost:3000**.
3. Enter the generated `STARTER_API_KEY` and a registered test passenger's phone
   number in international format. Click **API-Verbindung prüfen**. The server
   checks `/integrations/voice/caller`; it does not book anything.
4. For browser tests without a number, select the browser-test checkbox only if
   the organizers assigned an active **Web test user** to your integration.

`npm start`, `npm run dev` and `npm run example:search` automatically run setup
before starting. Existing `.env` files are migrated: obsolete identity-provider
settings are removed, missing settings added, and existing local/provider/team
keys preserved. The team secret must be supplied once; it cannot be shipped in
Git. A server restart keeps working with that configured secret.

Create test passengers and rides in the staging app. Use separate passenger and
driver accounts; drivers need approval and a vehicle. Every incoming call uses
the account matching its trusted provider phone number. A team credential does
not isolate rides or limit your server to one passenger.

## Two credentials for two connections

| Connection | Authorization |
| --- | --- |
| Phone provider → your starter `/api/...` | `Bearer <STARTER_API_KEY>` |
| Starter → mobie `/integrations/voice/...` | `Bearer <VOICE_INTEGRATION_SECRET>` (added server-side) |

Keep both credentials private. Do not put the mobie secret into model prompts,
browser code or public screenshots. Organizers can disable/rotate team access.
The normal app/admin login is managed separately from this starter.

## Connect your telephone service

Expose the starter through an HTTPS tunnel or deploy it with `HOST=0.0.0.0`
and HTTPS termination. Point your provider's HTTP integration at your public
starter URL and an endpoint in [docs/api.md](docs/api.md). Authenticate using
the local `STARTER_API_KEY`.

Your trusted provider adapter must add `X-Mobie-Caller-Phone` and
`X-Mobie-Call-Id` from **provider metadata**, never model tool arguments. The
starter forwards these headers to mobie; it does not parse Vapi/Fonio envelopes
or independently verify phone-number ownership. Keep each conversation's
locations, selected ride and confirmed action keys in your adapter. There is no
shared signed-in passenger or server-side fallback phone number.

For each write, add a stable `Idempotency-Key` and `confirmed: true` only after
explicit spoken consent. Save the key before sending and reuse it unchanged for
retries of that same action. Successful booking submission still requires driver
approval; read `/api/bookings` for the current decision.

## Call logs: configure the provider event webhook

The starter automatically **pushes tool logs** (arguments, results, timing and
errors) to the mobie backend for requests with a valid call ID. Full conversation
logging is also part of the integration: the provider must send its final report.

For **Vapi**, set the assistant's server/event URL to
`https://<your-starter>/vapi/events`, attach a Bearer credential with your local
`STARTER_API_KEY`, and enable `end-of-call-report` and `status-update`. The starter
normalizes and forwards those reports with the same mobie team secret.

For **other providers**, send a normalized report to `PUT /api/calls/{callId}`.
See **[central call log setup and report schema](docs/call-logs.md)** for the
required provider setup, delivery/retry behavior and examples. The backend does
not poll the teams for transcripts.

## First ride search

Copy `examples/search.json` to `my-search.json`; set confirmed locations and a
future ISO datetime with an explicit offset. Set `MOBIE_CALLER_PHONE` in `.env`
to your registered test passenger, then:

```sh
npm run example:search -- ./my-search.json
```

The example calls the running local starter. It only searches; `[]` is a valid
result. `MOBIE_CALLER_PHONE` and optional `MOBIE_CALL_TYPE=webCall` are used only
by this manual example, never as defaults for incoming telephone calls.

## Locations and POIs

The local `/api/locations/search` endpoint uses geocode.at's Austrian Address Register lookup. It matches street names with a city and optional postcode, then returns registered coordinates. No Mapbox token is required. When a house number is missing from the register, nearby registered numbers may be suggested; confirm the returned address with the caller. Preserve attribution. This lookup does not provide POI search. Mapbox remains available for custom integrations that supply their own token and permit permanent storage of results.

## Documentation and development

```sh
npm test
npm run dev
```

Tests use controlled responses and a local HTTP backend, without staging writes,
provider charges or credentials. CI runs Node 22 and 24. These checks do not
replace a live phone/provider integration test.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/config.js` | Team credentials and staging configuration |
| `src/mobie.js` | Voice API, caller validation, consent and action keys |
| `src/server.js` | Authenticated local HTTP endpoints and automatic tool logs |
| `src/call-log.js` | Vapi report normalization and central call/tool log delivery |
| `src/mapbox.js` | Optional location candidates |
| `src/index.html`, `src/page.js` | Manual caller connection check |
| `scripts/setup.js` | Safe configuration migration |
| `examples/search.js` | Search through the running starter |

Keep `.env`, call transcripts and personal test data out of commits. This is a
classroom starter for trusted team servers and staging accounts.
